Hi, My name is Edward Cui. In this proposed project, I analyzed the BBC Sound Effect dataset. There are 16 thousand audio recordings in this dataset.  In my preliminary analysis, I have determined that there are broadly 7 categories of sound effects, using natural language processing techniques to parse the descriptions of the audio. I have also determined that the audio profiles are separable when viewing them at Time Frequency space. My next step is to explore the potential ways to generate these sound effects of 7 categories using Generative Adversarial Neural Network model, using deep convolutional  and long short term memory architecture. The goal is to eventually build a deep generative model to simulate sound effects. One potential application of this model would be adding unique ambient sound effects to video clips.
